_[Css Selectors](https://flukeout.github.io)_

- Working in pairs through Css selector practice.

- A deeper understanding of How to communicate and solve problems as part of a team.

**Evening**

- How to solve problems the SOC way:

  1. Understand the problem
     Team question: 'Why is this important?'
     Team answer: 'To have a deeper understand of the root of the cause and think different angles about how to solve them'
  2. Breaking down the problem
     Team question: 'Why is this important?'
     Team answer: 'Is easier to break in little parts to tackle the attack'

  3. Looking for patterns
     Team question: 'Why is this important?'
     Team answer: 'Predict what can happen and develop a faster solution for problems

  4. Model Real world
     Team question: 'Why is this important?'
     Team answer: 'How: Variables, can be taken from the real world.
     Why: To prevent or solve a problem or improve a solution.'

  5. Algorithm
     Team question: 'Why is this important?'
     Team answer: 'A step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or accomplishing some end.

     An algorithm gives the computer a specific set of instructions, allowing it to do everything, from running a calculator to landing on the moon.'

  6. Program the solution

- A guide to SOC thinking once a week

  1.  Feedback
      Team question: 'Why is this important?'
      Team answer: ' Feedback is the best way to keep on track of tasks critical to advance and improve.'
