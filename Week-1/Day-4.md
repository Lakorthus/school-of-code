    - Article opinion: Benjamin Puusta
    "
        interesting... so if i understand correctly, the article argues that feedback, if you're only using yourself as a template, can miss the mark on what works well for others.  I suppose if you create this theory of excellence, it can be end up being more prescriptive EG -' you must be this way', rather than 'finding what works best for you alongside the rest of us'
