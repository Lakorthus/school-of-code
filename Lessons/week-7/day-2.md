 - Js methods Map, Filter, Reduce, Sort, Find, Some, Every FindIndex, Pop, Push.

    - Map => The map() method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array.

    - Filter => The filter() method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.

    - Reduce => The reduce() method executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each element of the array, resulting in a single output value.

    - Sort => The sort() method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the sorted array. The default sort order is ascending, built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code units values.

    - Find => The find() method returns the value of the first element in the provided array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, undefined is returned.

    - FindIndex => The findIndex() method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. Otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that no element passed the test.

    - Some => The some() method tests whether at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.

    - Every => The every() method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.

    - Pop => The pop() method removes the last element from an array and returns that element. This method changes the length of the array.
    
    - Push => The push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.
