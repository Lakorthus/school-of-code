One thing to realise with event listeners is that we (the developers) don’t call the event listener function ourselves in our code. Our function will be called automatically by the browser whenever the event (e.g. “click”, “change”, etc.) happens. Essentially, you’re telling the browser: “Hey, when a click happens, call this function I’m giving you”. - Liz(Coach)
